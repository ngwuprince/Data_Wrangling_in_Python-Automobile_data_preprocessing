# Data_Wrangling_in_Python-Automobile_data_preprocessing

About Project: Data preprocessing is a critical aspect of all stages of data analysis and predictive modeling, in this Project I accesses the automaker's data at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data to achieve the following OBJECTIVES:
- Identify and handle missing values
-- Identify missing values
-- Deal with missing values
-- Correct data format
- Data standardization
- Data normalization (centering/scaling)
- Binning
- Create Indicator variable(dummy variables) to represent data categories
- export the clean and transformed data for data analysis

At the end of the project, I was able to convert the data from the initial format to a format suitable for further analysis.

The Following question(s) was answered: 
- What is the fuel consumption (L/100k) rate for the diesel car?
